# CFD MODELLING OF WALL JETS

A two-dimensional turbulent wall jet in a quiescent surrounding was modelled using Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) based turbulence models available in the ANSYS Fluent 2020R2 software. The Reynolds number of the jet, Re = 9600, is based on jet inlet height, b and inlet velocity, ùëà 0 . The objective was to perform a comparative study and determine the most suitable turbulence model to simulate a turbulent wall jet, which has many industrial applications.
